    <h1> What Is A Computer Programmer? </h1>
    <p>
        Computer programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions in a computer, application or software program, and
         instructs them on how to perform. Computer programmers are professionals that create instructions
         for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.
         Computers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly
         complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible.
         But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. 
         That's what computer programming is all about. <br><br>
         <i> <mark> At its most basic, computer programming is little more than a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions.
         Based on the requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer programming can be as simple as adding two numbers.
         It can also be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate
        scheduling or critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds and challenges in games.</i>

<h2> Why Is it Important To Know About Computer Programming?</h2> 
    <p>
        If you are thinking about earning your computer programming degree, you will need to know about
        programming languages, classes, functions and commands. You will create applications, software or
        different programs. In addition, you may create programs that need to work on various operating
        systems such as iOS or Android. Those programs have different functions and classes, which means 
        they rely on different programming languages.
        All applications on the web are created using computer programming. The languages used in each 
        application you have range from similar to vastly different. Additionally, some languages create things
        that are running in the background, so you do not even know they are there. Learning computer
         programming languages allows you to be a versatile computer programmer.
